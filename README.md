This attack was written as part of a uni assignment. It is a simple bruteforce attack against sha256 hashes using a dictionary with common nouns, verbs, adjectives and firstnames (n, v, j, f respectively), of which is provided. This was purely written for academic purpose and was not intended for any malicious use. I do not take responsibility for what is done with this script.
